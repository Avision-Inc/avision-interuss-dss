    This repository contains a simple, open, and API used for separate UAS Service Suppliers (USS) to communicate during UAS operations, known as the InterUSS Platformâ„¢. This flexible and distributed system is used to connect multiple USSs operating in the same general area to share safety information while protecting operator and consumer privacy. The system is focused on facilitating communication amongst actively operating USSs with no details about UAS operations stored or processed on the InterUSS Platform.

    ### Main Features

    * Simple, open, flexible, and scalable information interface and Optimistic Concurrency Control to simplify USS to USS communication and control race conditions.
    * Effective information sharing to enable effective, deterministic conflict detection for flight planning across multiple overlapping 4D volumes from multiple USSs.
    * Effective reconstitution of flight volumes when restarting a USS or adding a USS to an existing environment.

    ### Main Assumptions

    * Trust each USS to deconflict with known flight data.
    * Auditing is available, as all USSs can verify the authorship and addition of erroneous conflictions.
    * Deconfliction is simply defined as no overlapping flights in time and volume.

    For more information, see the InterUSS Platform technical document located here: https://github.com/wing-aviation/InterUSS-Platform/raw/master/assets/InterUSS%20Platform%20Open%20Source%20Project-v1%20DRAFT.pdf or the executive summary located here:
    https://github.com/wing-aviation/InterUSS-Platform/blob/master/assets/InterUSS%20Platform%20Executive%20Summary-v1%20DRAFT.pdf

    ### NOTE

    This is a NASA UTM Project delta on the original.  In the future, this can be a branch or a fork from a publicly-available repo of InterUSS.

    # Try it out

    The below API are connected to a sandbox environment to allow you to try the different API. For endpoints with Authorization, use a NASA FIMS valid OAuth token or use 'tcl4box' (which works only in the sandbox environment). You can also use additional info at the end of the token to simulate multiple USSs (i.e. 'tcl4box-uss1').

          The level of announcements the USS would like to recieve related to operations
          in this grid cell.  Current just a binary, but expect this enumeration to grow
          as use cases are developed.  For example, USSs may want just security related
          announcements, or would only like announcements that involve changed geographies.
        enum:
          - NONE
          - ALL
      operations:
        type: array
        minItems: 0
        maxItems: 1000
        items:
          $ref: '#/definitions/GridCellOperationRequest'

  GridCellOperationRequest:
    type: object
    format: json
    required:
      - gufi
      - operation_signature
      - effective_time_begin
      - effective_time_end
    properties:
      gufi:
        type: string
        format: uuid
        description: >-
          GUFI for the Operation described this GridCellOperation.
        maxLength: 36
        minLength: 36
      operation_signature:
        type: string
        format: base64url
        description: >-
          The JWS signature of the Operation described by this GridCellOperation. The JWS signature
          is base64 URL encoded per specification.  The unencoded length of a SHA-256 signature is
          32 bytes and the unencoded length of other potential hash functions can be much longer.

          The min and max should take into consideration all potential base64url encoding of the
          JWS algorithms listed in the RFC: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3

          Currently, these values do not take this into consideration.
        minLength: 32
        maxLength: 200
      effective_time_begin:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        description: >-
          Start time of operation.
        minLength: 24
        maxLength: 24
        example: '2015-08-20T14:11:00.000Z'
      effective_time_end:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        description: >-
          End time of operation.
        minLength: 24
        maxLength: 24
        example: '2015-08-20T15:00:00.000Z'
